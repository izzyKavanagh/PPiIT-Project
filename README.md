## Network Simulation - NetSim
This project is a network simulation tool built using Java. 
The system simulates various network devices, such as routers, switches, and servers, 
and allows users to configure network elements like VLANs, IP addresses, and VLAN interfaces. 
The tool is designed to help users understand network configurations, simulate setups, 
and experiment with different network topologies.

## Features

- Simulates network devices like routers, switches, PCs and servers
- VLAN creation and port assignment
- IP addressing and helper address configuration
- DHCP & IP Pool configuration
- DNS server configuration & DNS record management
- Web Server
- Support for both guided and free modes

## Technologies Used
This project utilizes the following technologies:
- **Java**: The main programming language used to build the simulation.
- **Eclipse IDE**: Used as the development environment for coding and testing.
- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: Used for creating network layout designs before implementing the code.
- **GitHub**: For version control and managing the source code repository.
- **Java Swing**: Potential use for graphical user interface (GUI) improvements in the future.
